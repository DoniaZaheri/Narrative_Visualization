            <h1>MPG For Gas And Diesel Vehicles</h1>
            <h3> Fuel efficiency of the vehicles is an important factor in selecing a new vehicle. While gas and diesel cars run on different fuel, they both have similar designs and contain a combustion engine. The number of cylinders in the engine determine the maximum amount of fuel that could be continously introduced to the engine. While the number of cylinders is not a direct indicator of fuel consumption or maximum speed, it definitely plays a major role.
